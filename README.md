# Oblig3
The repository for this oblig contains a code that holds the logic, along with a test file running 4 different test values. The workflow file called test_oblig.yml validates the tests. The file checks and installs dependencies and runs pytest. Whenever something is commited to the github repository the files will be checked and validated by said file. When everything works as intented there will be a green checkmark on the web page.
